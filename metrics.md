Added new metrics and visualisations based on additional ONS series files:
- `series-211125.xls`: alternative GDP series (used for additional GDP indexing and comparison)
- `Prod-series-251125.xls`: alternative production output series

These are parsed via new loader functions (to be added) and used to build extra charts/KPIs in the dashboard for richer analysis of UK productivity and output dynamics.
